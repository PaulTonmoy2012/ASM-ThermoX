# ASM-ThermoX
ASM-ThermoX is an assembly language project developed using the EMU8086 emulator. This project simulates the behavior of various types of thermometers by changing their operational logic in assembly code.

Purpose:
The project aims to help users understand how digital thermometer systems work at the low-level (hardware) layer, specifically with 8086 microprocessor assembly programming. It gives insight into:

1. Reading temperature values (simulated)

2. Displaying those values in different thermometer formats

3. Switching between multiple thermometer types (like Celsius, Fahrenheit, or custom scale)
